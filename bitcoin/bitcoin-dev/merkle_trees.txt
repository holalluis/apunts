In each iteration, you concatenate two subsequent hashes of the previous level, 
and double-sha256 them. 
If there is an odd number of hashes, 
concatenate the last element with itself. 
This gives you a new list of hashes. Repeat, and stop when one hash remains. 
This is the merkle root.

Assume you have tx hashes Ha1,Ha2,Ha3,Ha4,Ha5,Ha6,Ha7

First iteration: Hb1=Hash(Ha1|Ha2), Hb2=Hash(Ha3|Ha4), Hb3=Hash(Ha5|Ha6), Hb4=Hash(Ha7|Ha7)
Second iteration: Hc1=Hash(Hb1|Hb2), Hc2=Hash(Hb3|Hb4)
Third iteration: Hd1=Hash(Hc1|Hc2) => Merkle root
