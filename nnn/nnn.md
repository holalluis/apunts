# nnn â€” the missing terminal file manager for X

DESCRIPTION
     nnn (Noice is Not Noice) is a performance-optimized, feature-packed fork
     of noice (http://git.2f30.org/noice/) with seamless desktop integration,
     simplified navigation, navigate- as-you-type mode with auto select, disk
     usage analyzer mode, bookmarks, contexts, application launcher, familiar
     navigation shortcuts, subshell spawning and much more. It remains a simple
     and efficient file manager that stays out of your way.

     nnn opens the current working directory by default if PATH is not specified.

KEYBINDS
     nnn supports both vi-like and emacs-like key bindings as listed below.
